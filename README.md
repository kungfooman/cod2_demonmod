Demon Mod for COD2. ver. 2.0

New to this release:

 1. Added COD4 Domination gametype. All the stock maps are supported for this, and 2 custom maps. You need to add the spawn points for the 3 flags to any custom map. Find the data in the scriptdata folder. . Just go round the map and in console type "/viewpos". This will be written to the mp_console.log file. Just find the coordinates and add them to the data file. Make sure you are careful about the format. NB - you cannot rotate maps when using the COD2 file functions. You will only get the first map. The file functions only fully work on a dedicated server.

 2. Added Retrieval gametype (not completed yet). Models for data book and field radio are from World at War. 

 3. Added Scavenger perk - players with this perk drop a scavenger pack. The model is from MW2.

 4. SD gametype has been updated with new bomb zone models from World at War

 5. Added First Aid perk - when a player with this perk dies, they drop a health pack.

 6. CTF gametype has had a cosmetic makeover - for example, the spinning base effects from DOM have been added.

 7. Added Hardline perk - this works just as it does in later COD games with this perk.

 8. Added throwing Ka-Bar knife.

 9. Added weapon pools - crates with spinning weapons above them are placed around a map. 

10. Added Kill Confirm gametype - dogtag models are from MW3.

11. Added Team Defender gametype.

12. Added start spawns. All the stock maps are supported, and 2 custom maps. You need to add the spawn points for any custom map not supported to the data file in scriptdata folder. Just go round the map and in console type "/viewpos". This will be written to the mp_console.log file. Just find the coordinates and add them to the data file. Make sure you are careful about the format. NB - you cannot rotate maps when using the COD2 file functions. You will only get the first map. The file functions only fully work on a dedicated server. 


Ranking is broken inasmuch as the persistent stat system is not in place. I had a fully working account system, but it got lost in the hard drive failure. It needs finishing off. I tied the Officer class to this system, and you will notice that you can't become an officer until you rank up to officer rank. But you loose the rank every time the map restarts or rotates.

I had a download checker system in place. This checked if you had downloads turned on and was tied to the account system. But it also got broken in the hard drive failure. So, it is turned off at the moment. You could perhaps look at it, as it is quite a nice system to ensure the player has the mod files before trying to play.
